# permutation-palette-picker
 
A visualiser web app designed to produce a list of all the permutations of a given 3 digit number. 
The visualiser produces 120 RGB colours for 3 digit numbers who's digits are all between 0 and 2.

The front-end was designed with custom CSS and made dynamic using React

The app can be run off a localhost. I used "http-server", installed via "npm install http-server".
